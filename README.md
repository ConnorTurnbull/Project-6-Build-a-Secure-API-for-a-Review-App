<h1>Project 6 - Build a secure API for a review app</h1>
<b>Scenario</b>
</br>
</br>

You have spent the past year or so as a freelance back-end developer, and you have worked on multiple projects of varying sizes and difficulties.

Last week, you received a message on your freelance account from Piiquante, a specialty maker of spicy, pepper-based condiments, asking for help with a new project. With the increasing popularity of specialty hot sauces thanks to the YouTube series "Hot Ones," Piiquante wants to develop a hot sauce review web app called "Hot Takes."

While the product manager at Piiquante eventually wants to transform the review app into an online store, she wants the first version to be a gallery that allows users to upload their favorite hot sauces and like/dislike ones that others share. The app’s front end has been developed using Angular and has been precompiled after internal testing, but Piiquante needs a back-end developer to build the API.

The deadline is manageable, so you decide to accept the project. After meeting with their product manager, Paula, you receive the following email:

 

>From: Paula Z</br>

>We are excited to have you contribute to the new app! As a small brand, this project will have a big impact on our growth.

>Attached is the API requirements specification. You can also find a link to the project repo here, where you’ll have access to the front end. 
>
>Please note the security requirements. We’ve experienced recent attacks on our website, so we want reassurance that the API for this app uses secure coding practices and protects all user passwords.

>Regards,

You’re ready to start on the API and heat things up!
